 # 🍀 Predicting Gender Using Naïve Baye
 Built a Naïve Bayes Classifier to predict gender from physical features. 🚀 Applied EDA, preprocessing, and feature scaling to improve accuracy. Strengthened skills in probabilistic modeling and supervised classification.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **Naïve Bayes Classifier** to predict gender based on physical attributes such as forehead dimensions and hair type.  
It strengthened my understanding of:  
- Naïve Bayes Algorithm (GaussianNB)  
- Feature Scaling & Preprocessing  
- Classification Report Analysis  

## 🎯 Objective
To classify gender (Male/Female) using probabilistic modeling with Gaussian Naïve Bayes.  

## 📂 Dataset Overview
**Features Used:**  
- Forehead Width (cm)  
- Forehead Height (cm)  
- Long Hair (binary)  
- Nose & Lip Shape attributes  

**Target:** Gender (Male or Female)
